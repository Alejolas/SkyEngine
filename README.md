# Credits
l0l1dk - the logic shared with me, originally written in D-Lang.<br>

# How it works
It just resets the "lua-tainted" address to 0 thousands/millions of times per second<br>
so all wow "protected lua" functions end up being called without issues 99% of the time,<br>
they are fooled into believing they not protected functions so run.<br>

# Will it work on Classic wow?
As of now yes, but that may change at anytime

# Can it be detected?
Yes<br>

# Will it be detected?
Maybe<br>
